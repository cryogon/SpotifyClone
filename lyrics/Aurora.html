        Cover me with your shining aura
        Grab my hand so I can be alright
        Color me just like an aurora
        Take my darkness away for tonight
        Cover me with your shining aura
        Grab my hand so I can be alright
        Color me just like an aurora
        Take my darkness away for tonight
        Cover me with your shining aura
        Grab my hand so I can be alright
        Color me just like an aurora
        Take my darkness away for tonight
        Cover me with your shining aura
        Grab my hand so I can be alright
        Color me just like an aurora
        Take my darkness away for tonight
        (Away for tonight, away for tonight, away for tonight, away for tonight)
        (Away for tonight, away for tonight, away for tonight, away for tonight)
        Cover me with your shining aura
        Grab my hand so I can be alright
        Color me just like an aurora
        Take my darkness away for tonight
        Cover me with your shining aura
        Grab my hand so I can be alright
        Color me just like an aurora
        Take my darkness away for tonight
